# Password-Generator
The Random Password Generator is a versatile tool designed to create strong, unique passwords tailored to user-defined criteria.
Users can input specific requirements such as length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). The generator then produces a random password that meets these specifications in a shuffled order. This project aims to enhance online security by providing users with complex, unpredictable passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive accounts and information.

# Concepts Practised
- Using the for loop with Python Lists
- For loops and the range() function
- Using built in python functions in the random module
